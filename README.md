<h1>Wine Quality Analysis</h1>

This project is a part of the AAI-500 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the
University of San Diego (USD).

-- Project Status: Active

<h2>Installation</h2>
This project can be run by running the wine_modeling.py script with python3. This assumes the data file, winequality-red.csv is in the winequality directory supplied in this project. There are a few dependencies that can be installed from the requirements.txt file. 
```python3 wine_modeling.py```

<h2>Project Intro/Objective <h2>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to analyze a chosen dataset and determine which model provides the best statistical analysis given the data. By incorporating several regression models and statistical analysis tools, this project is able to analyze several predictor variables against the quality of wine. Two datasets are included in this project, but only the one containing red wine samples was analyzed. </p>

<p>The applications of this work can be expanded on for ML applications in order to predict what physcochemical factors impact the quality of wine and if there is a way to predict this for future data samples.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<h3>Selected Dataset </h3>
<p>The focus of this research is the examination of datasets pertaining to the renowned Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine, encompassing both red and white variants. This exploration, however, predominantly centers on the red wine dataset. For detailed information on "Vinho Verde," one may refer to Cortez et al., 2009 or visit the official website (http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/). It is important to note that, owing to considerations of privacy and logistical constraints, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available for analysis. This omission encompasses data related to grape types, wine brands, selling prices, and other extraneous factors.</p>

<p>The dataset features a number of physicochemical properties and provides possibilities for both classification and regression tasks, presenting multiple avenues for exploration. To ensure the consistency of our analysis and the relevance of our findings, we have opted to focus exclusively on the red wine dataset. The differentiation between red and white wine data is essential, given the substantial divergence in their production processes. Our examination predominantly revolves around the physicochemical properties of red wines and their influence on overall quality. We took a  comprehensive exploration of the factors that contribute to the quality of red wine, using the principles of multiple regression. </p>
