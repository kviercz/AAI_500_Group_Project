<h1>Project Title</h1>

This project is a part of the AAI-500 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the
University of San Diego (USD).
-- Project Status: Active

<h2>Installation</h2>
This project can be run by running the wine_modeling.py script with python3. This assumes the data file, winequality-red.csv is in the winequality directory supplied in this project. There are a few dependencies that can be installed from the requirements.txt file. 

<h2>Project Intro/Objective <h2>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to analyze a chosen dataset and determine which model provides the best statistical analysis given the data. By incorporating several regression models and statistical analysis tools, this project is able to analyze several predictor variables against the quality of wine. Two datasets are included in this project, but only the one containing red wine samples was analyzed. </p>

<p>The applications of this work can be expanded on for ML applications in order to predict what physcochemical factors impact the quality of wine and if there is a way to predict this for future data samples.</p>
